TASK

LoadManager Project : (Get details from Arun if you do not have)
Video to explain below tasks: https://youtu.be/OiV1sAWwLNs 

1) Add a new field for Carrier Invoice#
Objective: Allow the user an option of entering in an invoice# for the carrier. Currently we use the Load# as the carrier invoice however many carriers have their own invoice number and it is often better to use that instead of the Load#. However not all of our customers want this so we need the option of displaying the Carrier Invoice# entry or not.
Create a new system setup option called “Enter Carrier Invoice#”. This is true/false field with a default value of false. If this is set to true display the Carrier Invoice# field below the Invoice Date Field as shown in the video.

USP_GetLoadDetails

2) Objective: Allow any user to add Dispatch Notes in the Load entry screen even if the load has reached a load lock status.
Let me elaborate and suggest how to do this. We have a feature that will lock the load once the load Status reaches a pre-determined status as defined in the System Setup. Once a load reaches this status or a status further on the list, only Administrators can edit the load. 
This is similar to the user Defined fields as shown in the video. When you edit those you will see a pencil appear to the right of the field when you click into it and it saves when you click or tab out (pencil disappears).
Note there are two “edit” modes for dispatch notes. One is to Add notes only and the other is to edit directly into the notes as shown in the video.

I assume this task will take a few hours. I am hoping not more than 2 or 3 hours. If it's a lot more please let me know, otherwise please proceed. The next task with SaferWatch API integration will be more involved. Then we will move onto the GPS work.
